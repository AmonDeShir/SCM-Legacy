# SCM-Legacy
Alright folks, enjoy :)

This doesn't mean I'm throwing the towel, but I don't think I should be holding the community back if they want SCM and I can't currently deliver on it.

I can't promise this is the most recent version of the code, but it *should* be. It's just what I happened to find among my backups.

Trigger warning: this code is bad. Very bad.
